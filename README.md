# opengl-car

#### Mini Project as part of my Computer Graphics course


Multiple perspective views of an animated formula 3 car on a circular racetrack. Keyboard input is taken to change the views. The wheels of the car are animated. A bird's eye point of view, driver's point of view, and views from the front and back of the vehicle are available. OpenGL functions are used through the GLUT library.

*To see the program in action, you'll have to make an executable file from the object file `main.o`  and then run that.*
